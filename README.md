# Furniture Shop Layout

A project to simulate a furniture shop app.

I was intending to develop an app with little more complex layout

I've implemented it based on a Flutter online course (Alura:https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/flutter-layout-aplicacao)

- Grid View
- Switch between different screens
- Gradient colors, Assets, json
- Send information to another screen (Navigator push/pop) / Routes
- StateFulWidget
- A specific folder to custom widgets
- Tested in Android and iOS
